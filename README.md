# game_test

This is Just a project testing out flutter flame.
It is based on the Flutter Flame Ember Quest tutorial. The only difference
being that the controls have been moved into a controller manager to
respond to both keyboard and touch events.

A mobile controller was added to support playing on a touchscreen device.
